  listOfPrimaryBios:
  - "This gruttel comes from a long lineage of honour rumble champions. It\u2019s
    a lot of pressure for a humble gruttel to bear, but they are determined to make
    their family, and the all powerful Nana Betsy, proud."
  - "This gruttel has always been quieter than most and sometimes struggles to socialise
    with the other gruttels. However, they understand that they can only help to
    keep the village clean and get their rocket ship built if they work with the
    other villagers. Perhaps they\u2019ll even make some friends through it all!"
  - "Competition is in this gruttel\u2019s nature! Whether it\u2019s the honour rumbles,
    butterfly eating contests, or cleaning the village - life's a competition to
    them, and they intend to win! But can they really succeed all by themselves?"
  - This gruttel is committed to building the best village possible! They love their
    colony and want to create a home that they can all be proud of. How can they
    possibly achieve that with all this rubbish lying around?
  - "This gruttel has always been a beacon of light to their friends. A shoulder
    to cry on - they remain optimistic through some of the harshest trials a gruttel
    can face. Will the world\u2019s troubles become too much for them to bear?"
  - Survival instincts are second nature to this gruttel! When things seem tough,
    you can be sure that this gruttel is tougher! They're more than used to facing
    a gruttel's challenges head on, but can they keep up the tough act forever?
  - All work and no play makes Holmfen dull and grey. That's what this gruttel believes!
    That's why they aim to spread a little bit of fun and cheer throughout the village,
    no matter the hardships they may face!
  - "This gruttel has a reputation for being a bit of a ditz. Their head is in the
    stratosphere most of the time and they don\u2019t get as much respect from the
    other gruttels because of this. Luckily for them, the other gruttels find them
    absolutely adorable and fall over themselves to look after the carefree creature!
    But perhaps the colony is overlooking this gruttel\u2019s hidden potential."
  - "What\u2019s beyond the stars? It\u2019s a question that keeps this gruttel up
    at night. Their wanderlust isn\u2019t satisfied by Holmfen alone. The Nana Betsy
    relics have to come from somewhere, and that\u2019s where this gruttel longs
    to be! If only they can win the honour rumbles, perhaps they will get to explore
    the galaxy that they admire from afar."
  listOfSecondaryBios:
  - While the recent changes have been stressful, they are doing their best to keep
    a positive attitude through it all! With their friends surrounding them, how
    hard can that be?
  - "They sense a storm brewing, as the boom bass have thrown a spanner into the
    village\u2019s plans. They want to do their part to help, but what can they do
    against such insurmountable odds? Nana Betsy must have the answers!"
  - "They won\u2019t admit it, but they\u2019re nervous. The boom bass have been
    the toughest challenge that the village has had to face so far! Will the gruttels
    be able to pull through?"
  - "Leaving their first village broke this gruttel\u2019s heart. Can they forge
    a new home here? Not with the boom bass making their lives a misery, they can\u2019t!"
  - "It\u2019s hard to remain strong when you\u2019ve been forced out of your home.
    Somehow, this gruttel is managing it. They refuse to let the boom bass get them
    down!"
  - "Fleeing the king junkers only to find themselves in the domain of the boom bass
    might seem like a loss for the gruttels. Sometimes, though, a strategic retreat
    is a good idea. So long as they keep tackling the rocket ship, this gruttel is
    sure things will turn out just fine!\_"
  - This gruttel has actually enjoyed the adventure of fleeing the king junkers!
    Of course, the boom bass have presented a new problem for the gruttels, but they
    are sure they can overcome this too!
  - "While the boom bass have caused problems for the village, this gruttel views
    it as a chance to grow! They really appreciate the support of the other gruttels,
    but they want to stand out! Whatever they can do to help the village, they\u2019re
    going to pull out all the stops!"
  - "\"Getting the rocket ship built has become this gruttel\u2019s number one priority,
    and the boom bass are making that quite a challenge! Still, if they keep recycling
    the stream of rubbish, they are sure the colony can finish it soon. Gruttels
    will be amongst the stars before you can say, \"\"Blast off!\"\"\""
  listOfTertiaryBios:
  - "They have stayed strong through two hectic moves and they believe that hope
    is on the horizon. The ship is nearly finished and Nana Betsy will see them through
    to the end!\r"
  - "They can see the light at the end of the bayou! If the village bands together
    to face the gunkadiles, this gruttel is sure they can complete their rocket in
    no time. They\u2019re proud to be part of such a wonderful colony!\r"
  - "They have discovered that the true might of the gruttels lies in the strength
    of the colony. As proud as they are of themself, they know that they couldn\u2019t
    have dealt with the king junkers or the boom bass alone. Now they will keep the
    gunkadiles at bay the same way. Together!\r"
  - "Fed up of running, this gruttel is determined to make a stand. This is their
    home, now! They will complete their rocket and no gunkadiles, boom bass, or king
    junkers are going to stop them this time!\r"
  - "A bit of optimism really does work wonders! Working together, the gruttels have
    made it this far. If they can achieve that, they can fend off the gunkadiles
    and finally complete their rocket ship!\r"
  - "The past few days have been very hard work for the gruttels, and it's unlikely
    that the gunkadiles will care. But fleeing can only get you so far. Sooner or
    later, you have to take a stand, and this gruttel is ready! That rocket ship
    will get built! For the gruttels! For Nana Betsy!\_\r"
  - "It looks like the spaceship will soon be complete, and it's a big source of
    excitement for this gruttel! Perhaps they'll even win the honour rumble and get
    to meet Nana Betsy in space! But they're getting ahead of themselves. First,
    the colony must hold off the gunkadiles!\r"
  - "This gruttel has become a bit of a folk hero amongst the colony. Their strength
    and support were invaluable for overcoming the king junkers and the boom bass.
    Now it\u2019s time for Holmfen\u2019s hero to hold off the gunkadiles until the
    rocket ship is finished!\r"
  - "While the past couple of homes have served their purpose for the gruttels, there
    is no more running away. The finishing touches are being made to the rocket and
    then a lucky gruttel will be making one final move. It's time for the gruttels
    to explore beyond the swamps of Holmfen, and this gruttel is proud to have helped
    the colony to reach this point!\r"
