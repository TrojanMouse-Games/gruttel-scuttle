Tiny,Collects and frames birthday cards,Won a butterfly eating competition three years in a row,This gruttel comes from a long lineage of honour rumble champions. It’s a lot of pressure for a humble gruttel to bear; but they are determined to make their family; and the all powerful Nana Betsy; proud.,While the recent changes have been stressful; they are doing their best to keep a positive attitude through it all! With their friends surrounding them; how hard can that be?,They have stayed strong through two hectic moves and they believe that hope is on the horizon. The ship is nearly finished and Nana Betsy will see them through to the end!
Razzamatazz,Secretly dislikes banjo music,Had a dream that Nana Betsy chose them as an apprentice,This gruttel has always been quieter than most and sometimes struggles to socialise with the other gruttels. However; they understand that they can only help to keep the village clean and get their rocket ship built if they work with the other villagers. Perhaps they’ll even make some friends through it all!,They sense a storm brewing; as the boom bass have thrown a spanner into the village’s plans. They want to do their part to help; but what can they do against such insurmountable odds? Nana Betsy must have the answers!,They can see the light at the end of the bayou! If the village bands together to face the gunkadiles; this gruttel is sure they can complete their rocket in no time. They’re proud to be part of such a wonderful colony!
Tank,Feels bad about eating butterflies,Fended off three king junkers all by themselves - allegedly,Competition is in this gruttel’s nature! Whether it’s the honour rumbles; butterfly eating contests; or cleaning the village - life's a competition to them; and they intend to win! But can they really succeed all by themselves?,They won’t admit it; but they’re nervous. The boom bass have been the toughest challenge that the village has had to face so far! Will the gruttels be able to pull through?,They have discovered that the true might of the gruttels lies in the strength of the colony. As proud as they are of themself; they know that they couldn’t have dealt with the king junkers or the boom bass alone. Now they will keep the gunkadiles at bay the same way. Together!
Doodle,Talks to Nana Betsy when the other gruttels aren’t listening,Set up a hotel in the village - sadly; Holmfen doesn’t get many visitors,This gruttel is committed to building the best village possible! They love their colony and want to create a home that they can all be proud of. How can they possibly achieve that with all this rubbish lying around?,Leaving their first village broke this gruttel’s heart. Can they forge a new home here? Not with the boom bass making their lives a misery; they can’t!,Fed up of running; this gruttel is determined to make a stand. This is their home; now! They will complete their rocket and no gunkadiles; boom bass; or king junkers are going to stop them this time!
Sizzle,Sometimes wonders if they can befriend their neighbours,Descended from the village’s founder,This gruttel has always been a beacon of light to their friends. A shoulder to cry on - they remain optimistic through some of the harshest trials a gruttel can face. Will the world’s troubles become too much for them to bear?,It’s hard to remain strong when you’ve been forced out of your home. Somehow; this gruttel is managing it. They refuse to let the boom bass get them down!,A bit of optimism really does work wonders! Working together; the gruttels have made it this far. If they can achieve that; they can fend off the gunkadiles and finally complete their rocket ship!
Strato,Believes they’re destined to win the honour rumble,Got lost in the bayou for three weeks; but fended for themselves and returned a hero!,Survival instincts are second nature to this gruttel! When things seem tough; you can be sure that this gruttel is tougher! They're more than used to facing a gruttel's challenges head on; but can they keep up the tough act forever?,Fleeing the king junkers only to find themselves in the domain of the boom bass might seem like a loss for the gruttels. Sometimes; though; a strategic retreat is a good idea. So long as they keep tackling the rocket ship; this gruttel is sure things will turn out just fine! ,The past few days have been very hard work for the gruttels; and it's unlikely that the gunkadiles will care. But fleeing can only get you so far. Sooner or later; you have to take a stand; and this gruttel is ready! That rocket ship will get built! For the gruttels! For Nana Betsy! 
Nimbus,Secretly dislikes the taste of Nana Betsy meals,The village's best musician,All work and no play makes Holmfen dull and grey. That's what this gruttel believes! That's why they aim to spread a little bit of fun and cheer throughout the village; no matter the hardships they may face!,This gruttel has actually enjoyed the adventure of fleeing the king junkers! Of course; the boom bass have presented a new problem for the gruttels; but they are sure they can overcome this too!,It looks like the spaceship will soon be complete; and it's a big source of excitement for this gruttel! Perhaps they'll even win the honour rumble and get to meet Nana Betsy in space! But they're getting ahead of themselves. First; the colony must hold off the gunkadiles!
Sirrus,Regularly dreams of flying,Performed a solo gruttel play in honour of Nana Betsy,This gruttel has a reputation for being a bit of a ditz. Their head is in the stratosphere most of the time and they don’t get as much respect from the other gruttels because of this. Luckily for them; the other gruttels find them absolutely adorable and fall over themselves to look after the carefree creature! But perhaps the colony is overlooking this gruttel’s hidden potential.,While the boom bass have caused problems for the village; this gruttel views it as a chance to grow! They really appreciate the support of the other gruttels; but they want to stand out! Whatever they can do to help the village; they’re going to pull out all the stops!,This gruttel has become a bit of a folk hero amongst the colony. Their strength and support were invaluable for overcoming the king junkers and the boom bass. Now it’s time for Holmfen’s hero to hold off the gunkadiles until the rocket ship is finished!
Astro,Sticks their tongue out when they’re focussing,Supposedly communicates with the ancient gruttel ancestors,What’s beyond the stars? It’s a question that keeps this gruttel up at night. Their wanderlust isn’t satisfied by Holmfen alone. The Nana Betsy relics have to come from somewhere; and that’s where this gruttel longs to be! If only they can win the honour rumbles; perhaps they will get to explore the galaxy that they admire from afar.,"Getting the rocket ship built has become this gruttel’s number one priority; and the boom bass are making that quite a challenge! Still; if they keep recycling the stream of rubbish; they are sure the colony can finish it soon. Gruttels will be amongst the stars before you can say; ""Blast off!""",While the past couple of homes have served their purpose for the gruttels; there is no more running away. The finishing touches are being made to the rocket and then a lucky gruttel will be making one final move.
